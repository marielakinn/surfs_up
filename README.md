# Surfs-up

## Project Overview

W. Avy is a potential investor who requested some weather statistical data to help him decide whether he should invest in Surf n’ Shake, an ice cream and surfing business based in Oahu, Hawaii.

To help with the decision making, the following data was pulled:

-	Summary statistics for the amount of precipitation in a year
-	Number of stations used to collect the information
-	Most active stations
-	Low, high, and average temperatures

The data seemed to be indicating that investing in Surf n’ Shake could be a good idea; however, W. Avy needed one more analysis.

### Purpose

The purpose of this analysis is to provide summary statistics of the temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

## Results

Provide a bulleted list with three major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.

## Summary

Provide a high-level summary of the results and two additional queries that you would perform to gather more weather data for June and December
